-- * Application Configuration

-- ** URLs and content body the 'redirectApp' uses to create a
-- response.

-- | The target 'URI' we'll be redirecting to.
newtype RedirectTo = RedirectTo {unRedirectTo :: URI}
    deriving (Eq, Ord, Show, ToSURI)

-- | This is a 'Prism' from any 'Text' value to a 'Maybe
-- RedirectTo'. This means that it will only create a 'Just
-- RedirectTo' when the 'Text' is a valid 'URI', and 'Nothing'
-- otherwise. We use this in 'redirectAppConfig' to figure out if we
-- can create a 'Just RedirectAppConfig' from the parameters we have.
--
-- 'Prism's work in two directions. In one direction, the "reverse"
-- direction, they take an input, and if the input is valid, they
-- return a 'Just' of the type's value.
--
-- In the "forward" direction, they return the valid value represented
-- by the underlying type. This is always going to be valid, because
-- the "reverse" operation has checked it for us.
--
-- We also use this in 'appConfig', which builds a 'RedirectAppConfig'
-- from the 'Text' extracted from the command line arguments:
--
-- @
--     uri  ^.pre redirectTo
-- @
--
-- This runs the 'preview' operator, the _reverse_ operator, which
-- takes our 'Text' argument, and if it can successfully convert it to
-- a URI, will hand us a 'Just' 'RedirectTo'. If it can't, it hands us
-- a 'Nothing'. And this is exactly what we need for figuring out if a
-- URI the person gave us is actually something a browser can use.
redirectTo :: Prism' Text RedirectTo
redirectTo =
    let
        uri r = (show $ unRedirectTo r) ^. packed

        redTo t = RedirectTo <$> checkUri t

-- | The message we'll send in the body of the redirect.
newtype RedirectBody = RedirectBody {unRedirectBody :: [Text]}
    deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)

-- | Convert between a 'RedirectBody', a list of 'Text' inputs, and
-- the same list of 'Text' values that'll become the content of the
-- body.
--
-- The body content has much less strict formatting requirements than
-- the URI, and really doesn't have any at all, so we're using an
-- 'Iso' instead of a 'Prism'.
--
-- 'Iso's are full bi-directional transformations between two
-- different types where there's no failure case. And since we're
-- really just wrapping the 'Text' list so we can let the compiler
-- check we're not passing around the wrong 'Text's, but otherwise,
-- really, we want the 'Text' list as is.
--
-- In fact, the way be defined 'RedirectBody' set us up for a really
-- simple 'Iso'' definition. We've already defined the backwards
-- ('unRedirectBody') and forwards ('RedirectBody') functions, and
-- that's all the 'Iso'' needs.
redirectBody :: Iso' RedirectBody [Text]
redirectBody =
    iso unRedirectBody RedirectBody

-- | Extracts the 'Text' from our 'RedirectBody' that can be used as a
-- response to the browser.
--
-- Now, since we want to use this as a message to the browser, we
-- need to use the 'ToMessage' typeclass, which lets Happstack know
-- how to send it back. And since we're essentially wrapping 'Text',
-- we can mostly use it's 'ToMessage' instance. But since we've got
-- the added list around it, we have to provide a way to convert our
-- list of 'Text's to just a single 'Text' before we can really take
-- advantage of the already-existing 'ToMessage' instance.
redirectBodyText :: Getter RedirectBody Text
redirectBodyText =
    let
        get b = buildText $ hsep $ over traversed print $ b ^. redirectBody
    in

-- | This tells HappStack how to convert our 'RedirectBody' into a
-- message for the browser.
instance ToMessage RedirectBody where
    -- | Here we cheat, and basically return 'toContentType' on an
    -- 'undefined' of type 'Text'. Since the 'toContentType' doesn't
    -- actually use the argument, and just the type of it, this is
    -- fine. It's also a fairly common thing to do, despite many
    -- people's reservations.
    toContentType = const $ toContentType (undefined :: Text)

    -- | And here we take our 'redirectBodyText' 'Getter' to turn our
    -- 'RedirectBody' into a single 'Text', then just use the
    -- 'toResponse' already defined for 'Text' to get our 'Message'.
    toMessage b = toMessage $ b ^. redirectBodyText

-- ** The Configuration of the 'redirectApp' Itself

-- | The 'redirectApp' uses to tell browsers where to look for the
-- information they requested.
data RedirectAppConfig = RedirectAppConfig {
    -- | This is the 'URI' that we'd like users to be redirected to
    -- after we record their hit.
    _appRedirectTo :: RedirectTo,

    -- | This is the body of the response we send the browser when we
    -- send it the new location.
    _appBody :: RedirectBody
    } deriving (Eq, Ord, Show)

-- *** 'Lens'es for the 'RedirectAppConfig'

-- | A 'Lens' that focuses on the 'RedirectTo' portion of our
-- 'RedirectAppConfig'.
appRedirectTo :: Lens' RedirectAppConfig RedirectTo
appRedirectTo =
    let
        getr = _appRedirectTo
        setr c t = c {_appRedirectTo = t}
    in
        lens getr setr

-- | Lens which focuses on the 'RedirectBody' of the
-- 'RedirectAppConfig'.
appRedirectBody :: Lens' RedirectAppConfig RedirectBody
appRedirectBody =
    let
        getb = _appBody
        setb c b = c {_appBody = b}
    in
        lens getb setb

-- | Builds a 'RedirectAppConfig' from the list of command line arguments if
-- possible.
--
-- Now, here, we use a 'Getter', which is one of the lesser types in
-- the 'Lens' family. But for building our configuration, where we
-- know we'll never want to see the original list of 'Arg's again,
-- it's perfect.
--
-- Now, since the 'RedirectTo' is defined by a 'Prism', we can't build
-- our 'RedirectAppConfig' as a normal function. We have to build it
-- using an 'Applicative', in this case a 'Maybe', since that's the
-- 'Applicative' of the 'preview' operation.
--
-- So this function, really, takes our command line arguments, a list
-- of 'Arg's, and then tries to build the 'RedirectAppConfig'. The way
-- the 'Maybe' 'Applicative' works is that if you chain them together
-- with the '(<*>)' operator, if at any point in the chain, you get a
-- 'Nothing', the result of the entire chain is 'Nothing'.
--
-- And so, when we try and run our 'RedirectAppConfig' over the
-- 'Maybe' 'Applicative', if 'preview' of the 'redirectTo' 'Prism' on
-- it's 'Arg' fails, we get a 'Nothing' back. And the caller knows
-- that the configuration isn't valid, so we shouldn't try and
-- redirect people's browsers to something that'll make them go
-- somewhere unsavory.
--
-- Now, one other thing we need to check is that we have enough
-- arguments. If the user only gave us a URI, for example, but no
-- message, we also fail. We require a body for the response to the
-- browser, and it's better if the user gives it to us than if we're
-- left to our own devices. Believe me, if you'd met us, you'd know.

-- used for diagnostic messages separate from normal output.

-- | A 'Conf' that has the 'ServerPartT' use our 'logRequest' function
-- for logging all browser requests.
serverConfig :: Conf
serverConfig = nullConf {logAccess = Just logRequest}

-- | A general HTTP server using our 'serverConfig', and thus our
-- 'logRequest' logger.
--
-- This also runs in 'MonadIO', which is a generalized 'IO' typeclass.
--
-- Any effect stack can be an instance of this typeclass, and most of
-- the <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/liblawless Lawless> package
-- is generalized for 'MonadIO'. When we use the 'putStrLn' from
-- 'Lawless', we get a lot of extra things that the regular version
-- doesn't have, including a lot of 'Text' and other type formatting
-- combiners, like 'hcat', 'hsep', 'fsep', and so on.
--
-- Most of the common types are also instances of the 'Printable'
-- typeclass provided by 'Textual', so they'll essentially work fine
-- with it. With the
-- <https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/8.0.2/docs/html/users_guide/glasgow_exts.html#overloaded-string-literals OverloadedStrings> language
-- extension, too, any literal text in double quotes "" can be
-- converted to any type that implements the
-- <http://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.9.1.0/docs/Data-String.html#t:IsString
-- IsString> typeclass.

-- | This is the function that gets called first.
--
-- Here, we take the command line arguments from 'args', then try and
-- build a 'redirectAppConfig'. If that works, we run the 'server'
-- with a 'redirectApp' configured with this
-- 'redirectAppConfig'. Otherwise, we call our 'exitFail' function
-- which tries to print a helpful message to the user.
--
-- The 'maybe' function is a function that takes any 'Maybe', and if
-- it's value is a 'Just', it will run a function over the value of
-- the 'Just' and return the result of that function as a regular
-- value, i.e. not a 'Maybe' value. Otherwise, it calls the fallback
-- function, and returns that value instead.
--
-- Now, we're being a bit tricky here. The functions we're using both
-- return values of 'IO' '()', which is an effect type, and we're also
-- running them over the 'IO' type, because we're inside 'main'. So
-- what happens is that 'maybe' will return either our 'server' or
-- it'll return our 'exitFail', and regardless of which one is
-- returned, they'll be run by 'IO' for their effects. That's what
-- 'IO' does.
